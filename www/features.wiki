<title>Features</title>

<ul>
  <li>
    Written from scratch on VS2008 specifically for ADO.NET 2.0, implementing all the
    base classes and features recently introduced in the framework, including automatic
    transaction enlistment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Supports the Full
    and Compact .NET Framework, and native C/C++ development.  100% binary
    compatible with the original sqlite3.dll.
  </li>
  <li>
    Full support for Mono via a &quot;managed only&quot; provider that runs against the
    official SQLite 3.6.1 or higher library.
  </li>
  <li>Full Entity Framework support (ADO.NET 3.5 SP1)</li>
  <li>
    On the Compact Framework, it is faster than SQL Server
    Mobile.  SQLite's installed size is a fraction of SQL Mobile's. It uses less memory at runtime, runs queries faster,
    and has a smaller database file size as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Encrypted database support.  Encrypted databases are fully encrypted and
    support both binary and cleartext password types.
  </li>
  <li>
    Visual Studio 2005/2008 Design-Time Support, works with all versions of VS2005/2008,
    including all Express Editions of VS2005.  You can add a SQLite
    database to the Servers list, design queries with the Query Designer,
    drag-and-drop tables onto a Typed DataSet, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Full SQLite schema editing inside Visual Studio.
    You can create/edit tables, views, triggers, indexes, check constraints and foreign keys.
  </li>
  <li>
    Single file redistributable (except on Compact Framework).  The core sqlite3 codebase and the ADO.NET wrapper
    are combined into one multi-module assembly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Binaries included for Itanium, x64, x86 and ARM processors.
  </li>
  <li>
    DbProviderFactory support.
  </li>
  <li>
    Full support for ATTACH'ed databases.  Exposed as <i>Catalogs</i>
    in the schema.  When cloning a connection, all attached databases are
    automatically re-attached to the new connection.
  </li>
  <li>
    DbConnection.GetSchema(...) support includes <i>ReservedWords</i>, <i>MetaDataCollections</i>, <i>DataSourceInformation</i>,
    <i>DataTypes</i>, <i>Columns</i>, <i>Tables</i>, <i>Views</i>, <i>ViewColumns</i>, <i>Catalogs</i>, 
      <i>Indexes</i>, <i>IndexColumns</i>, <i>ForeignKeys</i> and <i>Triggers</i>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enhanced DbDataReader.GetSchemaTable() functionality returns catalog, namespace
    and detailed schema information even for complex queries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Named and unnamed parameters.
  </li>
  <li>
    Full UTF-8 and UTF-16 support, each with optimized pipelines into the native
    database core.
  </li>
  <li>
    Multiple simultaneous DataReaders (one DataReader per Command however).
  </li>
  <li>
    Full support for user-defined scalar and aggregate functions, encapsulated into
    an easy-to-use base class in which only a couple of overrides are necessary to
    implement new SQL functions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Full support for user-defined collating sequences, every bit as simple to
    implement as user-defined functions and uses the same base class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Full source for the entire engine and wrapper.  No copyrights.
