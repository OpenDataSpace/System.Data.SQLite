<h2>Test Assumptions &amp; Prerequisites</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    The string &quot;&lt;root&gt;&quot; represents the root directory of your
    local source tree (i.e. the working check-out directory) for the
    System.Data.SQLite project.
  </li>

  <li>
    The string &quot;&lt;year&gt;&quot; represents the version of Visual Studio
    used (e.g. &quot;2008&quot; or &quot;2010&quot;) to build the binaries being
    tested.
  </li>

  <li>
    The string &quot;&lt;configuration&gt;&quot; represents the build
    configuration for the binaries being tested (e.g. &quot;Debug&quot; or
    &quot;Release&quot;).
  </li>

  <li>
    The string &quot;&lt;platform&gt;&quot; represents the native platform for
    the binaries being tested (e.g. &quot;Win32&quot; or &quot;x64&quot;).
  </li>

  <li>
    The string &quot;&lt;pid&gt;&quot; represents the process identifier for the
    instance of EagleShell being used to run the unit tests (e.g.
    &quot;1234&quot;).
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Test Procedures</h2>

<p>
  Follow these steps to unit test the System.Data.SQLite (SDS) binaries.
  Unless otherwise noted, all steps need to be done in the order specified.
</p>

<p>
  First, you will need a full source check-out for the System.Data.SQLite
  project, including the
  &quot;<a href="/index.html/dir?name=Externals/Eagle">Externals\Eagle</a>&quot;
  directory.
</p>

<p>
  The binaries to test must be [./build.wiki | built] or
  [./downloads.wiki | downloaded].  If the binaries are downloaded, they must be
  placed according to the build output directory structure (e.g.
  &quot;&lt;root&gt;\bin\&lt;year&gt;\&lt;configuration&gt;\bin&quot; for the
  separate managed and interop assemblies or
  &quot;&lt;root&gt;\bin\&lt;year&gt;\&lt;platform&gt;\&lt;configuration&gt;&quot;
  for the mixed-mode assembly).
</p>

<p>
  The new unit tests have been setup using <a href="http://eagle.to/">Eagle</a>
  and its associated unit testing framework, named &quot;EagleTest&quot;.  Eagle
  is an implementation of the <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl</a> scripting
  language for the Common Language Runtime (CLR).  EagleTest is the unit testing
  framework for Eagle, packaged as a collection of Eagle scripts, based loosely
  on the implementation of
  <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/tcltest.htm">tcltest</a>.

<h2>Automated Unit Tests</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open a normal command prompt window with &quot;cmd.exe&quot;.</li>

  <li>Change the current directory to &quot;&lt;root&gt;&quot;.</li>

  <li>
    Enter the following command to run all the unit tests against the binaries
    built with a separate managed and interop assembly:
    <b>Externals\Eagle\bin\EagleShell.exe&nbsp;-file&nbsp;Tests\all.eagle</b>
  </li>

  <li>
    Enter the following command to run all the unit tests against the binaries
    built with a mixed-mode assembly:
    <b>Externals\Eagle\bin\EagleShell.exe&nbsp;-initialize&nbsp;-runtimeOption&nbsp;native&nbsp;-file&nbsp;Tests\all.eagle</b>
  </li>

  <li>
    To test binaries built with MSBuild 3.5 or Visual Studio 2008 (i.e. because
    the default is to test binaries built with MSBuild 4.0 or Visual Studio
    2010) add the following command line argument right after
    &quot;Externals\Eagle\bin\EagleShell.exe&quot; in either of the above
    command lines:
    <b>-preInitialize&nbsp;&quot;set&nbsp;test_year&nbsp;2008&quot;</b>
  </li>

  <li>
    To test binaries built in the &quot;Debug&quot; build configuration (i.e.
    because the default is to test binaries built in the &quot;Release&quot;
    build configuration) add the following command line argument right after
    &quot;Externals\Eagle\bin\EagleShell.exe&quot; in either of the above
    command lines:
    <b>-preInitialize&nbsp;&quot;set&nbsp;test_configuration&nbsp;Debug&quot;</b>
  </li>

  <li>
    Make sure all tests pass; the log file
    &quot;%TEMP%\EagleShell.exe.test.&lt;pid&gt;.log&quot; may be checked if any
    errors should occur.  EagleTest should produce &quot;success&quot; messages
    very similar to the following:<br /><br />
    PASSED: 113<br />
    SKIPPED: 2<br />
    SKIPPED: installer-1.1 installer-1.2<br />
    TOTAL: 115<br />
    SKIP PERCENTAGE: 1.7391%<br />
    PASS PERCENTAGE: 100%<br />
    OVERALL RESULT: SUCCESS<br />
  </li>
</ol>
