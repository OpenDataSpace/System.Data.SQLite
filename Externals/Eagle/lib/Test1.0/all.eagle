# NOTE: *WARNING* This file must be capable of being evaluated in both Tcl and
#       Eagle in a completely "clean" interpreter; therefore, no script library
#       procedures provided by the Eagle.Library or Eagle.Test packages may be
#       used, including [isEagle], until after the test prologue has been
#       evaluated (below).  Unfortunately, this makes it somewhat impractical
#       to evaluate the test prologue using the abstracted [runTestPrologue]
#       script library procedure from the Eagle.Test package.  Instead, we must
#       assume that the test prologue file exists in the same directory as this
#       file and evaluate it using [source].  For third-party applications and
#       plugins that are Eagle-specific (i.e. they cannot be used in Tcl), the
#       following code snippet may be used instead of setting the "test_path"
#       variable and then evaluating the "prologue.eagle" file directly:
#
#           package require Eagle.Library
#           package require Eagle.Test
#
#           runTestPrologue
#
#       When using the above code snippet, the following code snippet may also
#       be used at the very end of the corresponding "all.eagle" file instead
#       of evaluating the "epilogue.eagle" file directly:
#
#           runTestEpilogue
#

  set test_path [file normalize [file dirname [info script]]]
